# Probabilistic-Learning-of-Dynamical-System
Probabilistic model has the ability to represent and manipulate the uncertainty in dynamical systems, which can make predictions and decisions.
In this work, we try to infer the parameters of the mathematical model using Particle Metropolis-Hastings (PMH). We also touch upon Kalman Filter and its variants.
The goal is to understand the concepts deeply. Lastly, we implement the Algorithms using MATLAB and Pycharm.
